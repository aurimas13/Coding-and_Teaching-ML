# AI still needs humans | Day 73

- While reading articles on AI wear realised that with the growing capabilities and outsource of AI across a lot fields one needs to think of AI as simply taking care of a grass. If you do not cut it will become overgrown and  messy. Same for AI: we need to make constant reviews to reduce AI biases, take care for changes that could weaken our data models and most importantly take care for our models daily to support our companies' future successes. It is worth noting that:
  - Just like physical tools such as laptops, allocate budget for AI wear and tear. Set aside funds in your company's annual spending forecasts for AI repairs and improvements, to ensure your business stays competitive with industry standards.
  - And a workforce that co-exists with AI breeds a stronger support system and more succesful environment where each can strive, with more people ready to spot issues and improvements and use artificial intelligence to its full potential. After all, returning to my grass analogy, the more hands that plant in our AI soil, the greater our businesses will grow.

# GPT4 | Day 76

- Fantastic how efficient GPT4 to its predecessor ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) has become. Its advantage over the predecessor to generate multimodal content which means it can produce images, audio and other types of media apart from text is amazing. A look at what we already know it can do can be found [here](https://pub.towardsai.net/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gpt-4-2fdf737e7862). If you also wish to get the most out of GPT4 by making correct prompts view this tweet [here](https://twitter.com/thealexbanks/status/1636375170616270851). Additionaly let's go in history and see what OpenAI's Chief Scientist said about the potential of multimodal AI back in 2020 as found [here](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ilya-sutskever-fusion-of-language-and-vision/?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_content=241730068&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-992153930095251456).

# GPT4 Again | Day 80

- Read a study about the impact of GPTs' on the US labor market that shows surprising figures:
  - ~ 80% of the workers may have at least 10% of tasks affected
  - ~ 19% of workers may see at least 50% of tasks impacted
The article could be found as pdf [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) or as an article on arxiv.org [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130).
- GPT4 might also have some flaws like it is constrained by an extensive set of human-crafted “guardrails” that seek to prevent it from being offensive or off the wall, it doesn’t update its knowledge in real time, its command of languages other than English is limited, it doesn’t analyze audio or video and it still makes arithmetic errors that a calculator would avoid but the prospect for the future of OpenAI is bright. Those very likely will be overcome with GPT5. More about that [here](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/commentary-openais-gpt-4-has-some-limitations-that-are-fixable-and-some-that-are-not/).

The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. Details can be found as item **95** [here](#worthy-tools) or accessed directly through [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04226).

What that means is that they included Copilot Pull Requests and a chat interface ran on GPT-4 integrated with VS Code and Visual Studio. More details [here](https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/).

# Generative AI and Prompt Engineering for DS | Day 89

Found a great [ebook](http://bit.ly/3ZjUR7q) on the latest trends and techniques to unlock the full potential of AI in various applications. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide on generative AI and prompt engineering, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools necessary to excel in the realm of datascience. Generative AI encompasses a range of models and techniques designed to generate new data based on existing input data. These models have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language processing, image generation, and more. By understanding the mechanics and intricacies of generative AI, data scientists can harness its power to create innovative solutions for a multitude of problems. Prompt engineering, on the other hand, deals with the art of crafting eective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs. As AI models become more sophisticated, the need for efficient and precise prompt engineering has grown more critical. By mastering this skill, data scientists can better direct AI models to produce targeted results, ultimately enhancing the efficacy of their applications. It delves into the key concepts, best practices, and real-world applications. More at the book through pressing the link above.
