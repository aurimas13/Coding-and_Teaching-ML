## Generative AI: Dreaming up proteins | Day 12

-   **DeepMind's AlphaFold Solution**:
    -    Solved the "protein folding problem."
    -   Allows prediction of protein's structure from its amino acid sequence.
    -   A major breakthrough that had eluded science for nearly a century.

- **Importance of Protein Structure**:
    -   Essential to understanding the function of proteins.
    -   Includes functions like oxygen carrying in red blood cells and enzymes' digestion of starches.

- **Impact of AlphaFold**:
    -    Accelerated research across all biology fields.
    -   Used in the development of malaria vaccines, cancer drugs, plastic-digesting enzymes, and solar energy conversion.
    -   AlphaFold Protein Structure Database used by over 1.2 million researchers.

## GPTCache | Day 13

- You can cut your GPT API expenses by 50% through caching using LangChain and GPTCache.

GPTCache uses embedding algorithms to convert queries into embeddings and uses a vector store for similarity search on these embeddings. 

This process allows GPTCache to identify and retrieve similar or related queries from the cache storage.

You will also benefit from significant response time increase and API rate limit restrictions.

To install run `pip install gptcache` and to learn more visit [here](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache) that is also available under Worthy Repositories as 23rd item there in the main repository's [README](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/tree/main).
