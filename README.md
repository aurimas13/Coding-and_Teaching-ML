<b> Overview & Next Move</b>
</p>

With the start of **100DaysOfMLCode** challenge this Machine Learning Goodness repository is updated daily with either
the completed Jupyter notebooks, Python codes, ML projects, useful ML/DL/NN libraries, repositories, cheat codes of ML/DL/NN/AI, useful information such as websites, beneficial learning materials, tips and whatnot not to mention some basic and advanced Python coding.

As the challenge is over the repo still grows. New beneficial material or materials in the world of Machine Learning when found is/are added to [books](#worthy-books), [tools](#worthy-tools) or [repositories](#worthy-repositories) as well as updated in [FinishYearWithML](#finishyearwithml) challenge and tweeted through my Twitter account and on Linkedin as well as sometimes on Facebook, Instagram.

# Public

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Public folder contains two files:

- [todolist](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Public/todolist.txt) - the TO DO List.
- [Images](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/tree/main/Public/Images) - the Images folder.

# Jupyter in Browser

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

First nice thing is that you could run Jupyter also through browser by doing so going [here](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html) and reading more about it in this [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/run-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-web-browser-using-jupyterlite-18e3bd25bd97).

If you find difficulty in running Jupyter Notebook through Browser then you could use Google Colab by clicking
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Functionalities of both machines are similar.
